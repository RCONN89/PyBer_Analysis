# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis was done to analyze Pyber data based on city type
## Results
Results showed that urban cities lead the way in Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares, but rural cities lead in Average fare per ride and Average fare per driver
## Summary
Based on the above data it looks like we need to increase fare rates for drivers in urban cities to make it possible for drivers to earn more money. We also need to encourage more drivers to drive in rural cities.
